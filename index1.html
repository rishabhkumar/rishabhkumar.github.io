It's 'Play', 'Pause', 'Stop' buttons also are created by me rather than using 'MediaPlayer' class to provide for the pre-written media player in the android.

API used for fetching the lyrics: <b>JSOUP</b></p><p>At the moment the app is not coded for scanning the whole mobile device and show the music list as the main aim while creating the app was to create a music player directly from scratch without using any predefined media players and to fetch the lyrics from the internet.

For fetching recent news no additional server is required as by using JSoup API, the app automatically fetches the news from the website itself.</p><p>As requested by out mentor scientist, we also added a short quiz in the app which asks questions about the DRDO itself and also it's products. To maintain the score records, SQLite database is used. The whole of UI as well as backend part have been made from scratch by us.</p></div>

This application on registration creates a new space for the user to store files in. The user has a choice to either upload the file privately in the space allocated or in the public space for everybody to see and download maybe.</p><p>For private storage, the user can still share the file just by writing the target user's username. The database used for maintaining records is MySQL</p><p>I handled all the backend issue of this project involving all the database interaction with the server.

The neural network is implemented solely on Java from scratch. It uses Backpropagation algorithm to 'learn'. The GUI also, is implemented in Java.</p><p>For storing the image information, the image or the grid is binarized into a matrix which is then used later for training the whole network to perform more accurately based on the patterns drawn earlier. As we have used a neural network, hence, the more the test cases, the more accurate is the recognition.</p></div>
